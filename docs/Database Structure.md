Detailed Database Structure
Based on the requirements for a movie, series, and cartoon management platform, the database structure can be designed to efficiently store and manage user profiles, media content, user interactions, and comments. Below is a detailed schema that outlines the tables, their attributes, relationships, and data types.
1. Users Table
Stores information about registered users.
Column Name	Data Type	Constraints
user_id	INT	PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT
username	VARCHAR(50)	UNIQUE, NOT NULL
password	VARCHAR(255)	NOT NULL
profile_picture	VARCHAR(255)	
created_at	DATETIME	DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
2. Profiles Table
Stores multiple profiles for each user.
Column Name	Data Type	Constraints
profile_id	INT	PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT
user_id	INT	FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
profile_name	VARCHAR(50)	NOT NULL
created_at	DATETIME	DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
3. Movies Table
Stores information about movies, series, and cartoons.
Column Name	Data Type	Constraints
movie_id	INT	PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT
title	VARCHAR(255)	NOT NULL
description	TEXT	
cover_image	VARCHAR(255)	
release_date	DATE	
genre	VARCHAR(100)	
rating	FLOAT	
4. Favorites Table
Links users to their favorite movies.
Column Name	Data Type	Constraints
favorite_id	INT	PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT
user_id	INT	FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
movie_id	INT	FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Movies(movie_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
5. Watchlist Table
Tracks the status of movies for each user.
Column Name	Data Type	Constraints
watchlist_id	INT	PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT
user_id	INT	FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
movie_id	INT	FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Movies(movie_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
status	ENUM('want_to_watch', 'watching', 'watched')	NOT NULL
6. Comments Table
Stores user comments on movies.
Column Name	Data Type	Constraints
comment_id	INT	PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT
movie_id	INT	FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Movies(movie_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
user_id	INT	FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
comment_text	TEXT	NOT NULL
created_at	DATETIME	DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
updated_at	DATETIME	DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
Relationships
Users can have multiple Profiles (one-to-many relationship).
Profiles are linked to a single User (many-to-one relationship).
Users can have multiple Favorites (one-to-many relationship).
Favorites link a User to a Movie (many-to-one relationship).
Users can have multiple entries in the Watchlist (one-to-many relationship).
Watchlist entries link a User to a Movie with a specific status (many-to-one relationship).
Movies can have multiple Comments from different Users (one-to-many relationship).
Comments link a User to a Movie (many-to-one relationship).
Data Integrity Rules
Entity Integrity: Each table must have a primary key that uniquely identifies each record.
Referential Integrity: Foreign keys must reference valid primary keys in their respective tables. If a referenced record is deleted, related records should also be deleted (ON DELETE CASCADE).
Business Logic Integrity: Comments must be associated with valid movies and users. Status in the watchlist must be one of the predefined ENUM values.
Indexing and Performance
Create indexes on frequently queried columns, such as username, movie_id, and created_at in the Comments table to enhance retrieval speed.
Consider using views for commonly accessed queries that join multiple tables, such as retrieving a user's favorite movies along with their comments.
This detailed database structure provides a robust foundation for managing users, their profiles, and their interactions with movies, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying capabilities.
