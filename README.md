## Agile Methodology

### Overview

[Agile methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) is a project management approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress towards a well-defined goal. It is particularly effective in software development where requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams. Agile methodologies aim to deliver small, incremental changes in a product to improve quality and adaptability to changing needs.


### MoSCoW Prioritization

The [MoSCoW prioritization technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) is used to determine the importance of various features and tasks in a project. This method categorizes features into four groups: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. This helps in effective time management and ensures that the most critical functionalities are delivered first.

### GitHub Projects

Using GitHub Projects, tasks are managed and progress tracked through project boards. Each board will represent an EPIC, with columns for tasks, their statuses (To Do, In Progress, On Hold, Done, Bugs). Issue labels include the user, prioritization and sprints.

![Kanban Board](docs/kanban.png)

### EPICS

Epic is a large body of work that is broken down into user stories. Each Epic in this project represents a key aspect of the platform's development and ensures comprehensive coverage of the required functionalities.

- [EPIC 1](https://github.com/barkode/storelinks/issues/4)
- [EPIC 2](https://github.com/barkode/storelinks/issues/5)
- [EPIC 3](https://github.com/barkode/storelinks/issues/20)
- [EPIC 4](https://github.com/barkode/storelinks/issues/22)
- [EPIC 5](https://github.com/barkode/storelinks/issues/24)
- [EPIC 6](https://github.com/barkode/storelinks/issues/25)
- [EPIC 7](https://github.com/barkode/storelinks/issues/26)
- [EPIC 8](https://github.com/barkode/storelinks/issues/27)

### User Stories

With an emphasis on delivering a seamless user experience, the goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive platform that serves both visitors and registered users. The platform will allow for the development and maintenance of content, present developer profiles, and provide opportunities for interaction.  The following user stories outline the essential functionalities and the rationale behind them.

- As a registered user, I want to be able to log in and out of my account so that I can use the platform.
- As a registered user, I want to manage my profile so that I have control of the information held on the platform.
- As a registered user, I want to be able to comment on posts so that provide feedback to authors.
- As a registered user, I want to be able to delete and edit comments so that I can control my engagement on the platform.
- As an Administrator, I want the ability to perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations so that manually manage, control and edit content.
- As an Administrator, I want to approve comments and posts so that I can ensure content quality and appropriateness before it is published.

## Website Goals and Objectives

Website Objectives:

## Wireframes

The wireframes for the platform provide a visual representation of the layout and structure of the application. They outline the placement of key elements such as navigation menus, user profiles, content areas, and interactive features. The wireframes ensure a cohesive and intuitive user interface, guiding the design and development process. After the extensive testing was conducted, naturally there are some deviations from wireframes in the live version of the platform.

## Database Schema

The database schema outlines the structure and relationships between key tables for the platform. The **User** table stores basic user information and authentication details. The **Profile** and **DevProfile** tables extend user details with personal information, bios, and links. The **Category** table categorizes content, while the **Post** table manages user-generated content with fields for title, content, author, and metadata. The **Comment** table handles comments on posts, including author information. These tables are designed to ensure efficient data management and robust user interactions on the platform.

This schema was generated using [drawsql.app](https://drawsql.app/).

All the movie information was taken from the [example database json file](https://github.com/toedter/movies-demo/blob/master/backend/src/main/resources/static/movie-data/movies-250.json ). Based on the data from this file, models for movies and genres were built.

## Design Choices

The site is made in black and white with color accents on some elements. A simple design with thin lines and not many elements on the page was chosen.
The design of the site is based on a [template that can be downloaded for free](https://bootstrapbrain.com/template/free-bike-repair-bootstrap-html-website-template-presta/).

### Typography

[Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) is one of the world's most used typefaces with applications ranging from computer interfaces, advertising & airports, to NASA instrumentation & medical equipment.

![Inter font](docs/font.png)

### Colour Scheme

![Color scheme](docs/pallete.png)

### Images

All movie posters are downloaded from a remote server. The paths to these images were taken from the example database.

[Back to top](#contents)

### Responsiveness
The site was developed using the Bootstrap 5 CSS framework. Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as grid tiers, for building responsively. These breakpoints can be customized if youâ€™re using our source Sass files.

![Breakpoints](docs/brackpoints.png)

## Security Measures and Protective Design

### User Authentication

- New user registration and existing user login were done using standard Django tools.

### Password Management
 
- Utilize Django's built-in tools for password management to securely hash and store passwords.

- Implement robust password policies to strengthen the security of user accounts.

### Form Validation

Validation of forms is performed both on the client side using the built-in capabilities of the browser (html), and on the server side using the database.

### Database Security

All important information for database access is stored in a virtual environment. The key files are stored in an .env file. The file itself is added to the list of ignored files.

## Deployment

### To deploy the project to Heroku

Follow these steps to deploy your Django project to Heroku from VS Code:

#### **Step 1.** Create a New Heroku App
  - Access the Heroku Dashboard: Log in to your Heroku account and access the dashboard.
  - Create a New App: Click on the New button in the top-right corner of the dashboard and select Create new app from the dropdown menu.
  - App Name and Region: Enter a unique name for your app and choose a region closest to you (EU or USA). Click Create App to create the app.

#### **Step 2.** Configure Environment Variables
  - Reveal Config Vars: From the new app Settings, click Reveal Config Vars.
  - Set Environment Variables: Set your environment variables as follows:
    * `CLOUDINARY_URL`: Insert your own Cloudinary API key here.
    * `DATABASE_URL`: Insert your own ElephantSQL database URL here.
    * `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC`: Set to 1 for temporary purposes, and remove it for the final deployment.
    * `SECRET_KEY`: This can be any random secret key.

#### **Step 3.** Prepare the Project for Deployment
  - Create a `requirements.txt` File: This file lists all the dependencies required by your project. You can install the project's requirements using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. If you have your own packages installed, update the `requirements.txt` file using `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`.
  - Create a `Procfile`: This file specifies the commands Heroku should run to start your app. Create the Procfile using `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`. Replace `app_name` with the name of your primary Django app, which is the folder where `settings.py` is located.

#### **Step 4.** Connect Your GitHub Repository to Heroku
  - Automatic Deployment: Select Automatic Deployment from the Heroku app settings to automatically deploy your app whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository.
  - Manual Deployment: Alternatively, you can connect your GitHub repository to Heroku manually using the Terminal/CLI:
  - Login to Heroku: Run `heroku login -i` to log in to your Heroku account.
  - Set the Remote for Heroku: Run `heroku git:remote -a app_name` to set the remote for Heroku. Replace `app_name` with your app name.
  - Push to Heroku: After performing the standard Git add, commit, and push to GitHub, you can now type `git push heroku main` to deploy your app.

#### **Step 5.**  Verify Your Deployment
  - Open App: Once your app is deployed, you can open it by clicking on the Open App button in the Heroku dashboard. This will open your app in a web browser.
  - Verify App: Verify that your app is running correctly by checking for any errors or issues.
